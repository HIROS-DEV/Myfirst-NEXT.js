## Impressions

It is my first Next.js project.

Already I know React.js and I am familiar with it.
So, why am I study Next.js?

Because, in the near future, I think Next.js will take the place of React.js.
(Or, React.js will evolve from just frontend library to full stack library.)

And, today, it is good timing for learning Next.js for me.

Thank you for reading. And, happy coding!!!
